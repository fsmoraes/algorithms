This repository contains implementations for the most common sort algorithms.

## Time Complexity Average Time

Bubble Sort - O(n²)  
Selection Sort - O(n²)  
Insertion Sort - O(n²)  
Merge Sort - O(n log(n))  
Quick Sort - O(n log(n))


## Space Complexity

Bubble Sort - O(1)  
Selection Sort - O(1)  
Insertion Sort - O(1)  
Merge Sort - O(n)  
Quick Sort - O(log(n))
