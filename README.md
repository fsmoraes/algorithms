This repository contains implementations for the most common sort algorithms.

Algorithm    | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Bubble Sort    | O(n)  | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1)
Insertion Sort | O(n)  | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1)
Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1)
Merge Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n)
Quick Sort     | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n)


### Bubble Sort
A sorting algorithm where the largest value bubble up to the top!  
The way that bubble sort works is that as we loop through each item we compare it to the next item in the array.  
If the value is larger than next value, we swap. Basicaly we swap if something is larger.
